<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a user I want to be able to create my own regiment that will include meal plans and exercise's within it.</p>

<h2>Background Info</h2>

<p>When you come to my website you will need to automatically login. However there is another link that will take you to my bio in case you wanted to learn more about me. Once you login with your google credentials you will be able to see the page where you should see everybody's posts. There will be three links provided which are the 'Create Regiment','View Profile', and of course the logout link.</p>
<p>Once you go to create your regiment, you will be asked to type in your height, weight, and a brief description of what you want to accomplish.</p>

<p>It will then take you to your profile where you can go add meals and exercises.</p>

<h2>Future Developments</h2>
    <p>In the future I would like to include a search algorithm where you could look up somebody else's regiment and see what they included in their regiment. I would also like to complete the update portion in CRUD so you will be able to post it on the 'Welcome Page' so everybody can see your regiment. I would like to also convert my logo into a link that will always take you to the front-page. I would also like to include a card hover effect that once you hover over it, you will be able to see your info.</p>
