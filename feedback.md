#### Feedback:  

Splendid job all around my man. It was a great learning experience building your own server, and routes, which is what I think you had the biggest trouble with. It can be really hard when you first take on something of this calibre but it's all about the learning experience. I would suggest taking the extra hour or two when you go about the planning process, especially when you put the user functions into terms of routes. 

I do recommend leveraging CSS frameworks going forward, even if their application is minimal (so that way you can still do your own custom CSS). They will help you build really great looking websites much faster, even by incorporating the basics (navbar, footer etc.).

Even if the project is more of a demonstration of skills as compared to something that may have real world application, you need to make your app have a common theme, otherwise it will just confuse whoever uses it. For example this is an exercise tracker, that goes into a little about yourself. Nothing wrong with that, especially if you talk about what motivated you to build the application, however the about me didnâ€™t really seem to touch on that point. From first impressions, this may confuse some people. If you want to have an exposition of yourself I do suggest that you  build a portfolio, and represent that information there. You can always leave links to projects in the portfolio, and in the individual projects, leave links to the portfolio. 

Otherwise fantastic job my man, you did really well. I'm excited to see what you are able to build with the Python, Django stack!
